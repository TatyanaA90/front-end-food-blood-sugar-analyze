### Frontend Analysis — Predefined Meals vs “Choose from options” Flow

Scope: Analyze why selecting preset/common meals still requires manual ingredient entry, and propose an improvement plan. No code changes are made in this document.

## Current Behavior (as implemented)

- `MealForm.tsx`
  - Provides a toggle between:
    - “Choose from Options” (descriptionType='preset') — shows a static “Common Meals” select that only fills the description field; it does not populate ingredients.
    - “Custom Description” — user types their own description.
  - Has a separate button “Choose from Templates” that opens `PredefinedMealSelector` as a modal.
  - Ingredients section is always shown and is manual by default when using the “Choose from Options” path.

- `PredefinedMealSelector.tsx`
  - Loads predefined meals and categories from backend endpoints:
    - `GET /predefined-meals` (with optional category)
    - `GET /predefined-meals/categories/list`
  - Allows selecting a predefined meal, adjusting per-ingredient weights, scaling by quantity (1–10), and confirms selection.
  - On confirm, calls parent callback with `(meal, quantity, ingredientAdjustments)` which `MealForm` uses to request backend creation via `POST /meals/from-predefined`.

- `mealService.ts`
  - Defines types for `PredefinedMeal`, `PredefinedMealIngredient` and helpers to scale nutrition.
  - Implements `createMealFromPredefined` that posts to `/meals/from-predefined` with optional `ingredient_adjustments`.

## User Expectation vs Implementation

- Expectation: When the user chooses “choose from options” and then selects a common meal, the form should pre-populate ingredients and key properties from a predefined template (admin-defined), and the user can optionally modify or add ingredients.
- Current: The “Common Meals” select in `MealForm.tsx` only sets the description string. It is not connected to predefined meals data and does not auto-populate ingredients. The predefined-meal experience is separated behind the “Choose from Templates” button.

## Root Cause

- There are two parallel flows:
  1) “Choose from Options” → static common meals list → sets description only.
  2) “Choose from Templates” → fetches admin-defined predefined meals → can create directly with adjusted ingredients.
- Because the “Common Meals” select is not backed by predefined-meal data, users selecting it still need to manually enter ingredients.

## Improvement Plan (no code changes yet)

Priorities focus on UX unification and leveraging existing predefined meals API to avoid manual ingredient entry.

1) Unify selection flows
   - Replace the static “Common Meals” dropdown under “Choose from Options” with a selector that is backed by predefined meals (same data source as `PredefinedMealSelector`).
   - Options:
     - Inline embed a simplified predefined meal picker in the preset section, or
     - When a user chooses a meal type/common option, open the `PredefinedMealSelector` pre-filtered by category.

2) Two actions when a predefined meal is selected
   - Provide both:
     - “Add This Meal” (existing flow) — calls `POST /meals/from-predefined` immediately.
     - “Load Into Form” — pre-fill the form’s ingredient list and totals with the scaled ingredients so the user can edit before saving as a custom meal.
   - This keeps the admin-defined template as a starting point while preserving full user control.

3) Map “Common Meals” to real templates
   - If you want to keep a curated list, back it by categories or tags in `/predefined-meals`. Selecting a common meal triggers fetching the template by id and either:
     - opens `PredefinedMealSelector` on that item for confirmation, or
     - directly pre-fills the form via the “Load Into Form” behavior.

4) Clarify UI labels to reduce confusion
   - Rename “Choose from Options” to “Choose a Template or Enter Custom”.
   - Rename “Choose from Templates” to “Choose Predefined Meal”.
   - Move the “Choose Predefined Meal” button into the preset UI section so users see one coherent path.

5) Preserve editability and advanced adjustments
   - Continue supporting `ingredient_adjustments` and quantity scaling in `PredefinedMealSelector`.
   - When “Load Into Form” is used, convert the scaled results into editable `ingredients` entries in the form.

6) Optional enhancements
   - Add tabs or filters in `PredefinedMealSelector` for “Admin Templates” vs “My Templates” (future feature).
   - Cache categories and last used category to streamline selection.
   - Provide nutrition preview in the preset path when a template is highlighted.

## Affected Components/Files (for later implementation)

- `src/components/meals/MealForm.tsx`
  - Replace/augment the static “Common Meals” select to trigger or embed predefined meal selection.
  - Add the “Load Into Form” path to populate `ingredients` with scaled values.

- `src/components/meals/PredefinedMealSelector.tsx`
  - Accept optional initial category/template id to pre-filter or pre-select.
  - Expose both “Add This Meal” and “Load Into Form” callbacks, or pass a mode flag from parent.

- `src/services/mealService.ts`
  - Ensure interfaces cover any additional fields needed (e.g., tags/categories for curated “common” options).
  - Keep `createMealFromPredefined` unchanged; add helper to transform a `PredefinedMeal` into a form-ready `MealCreate` payload when “Load Into Form” is used.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Selecting a meal in the preset path results in either:
  - A created meal with pre-populated ingredients (no manual entry needed), or
  - A pre-filled, editable form with ingredients sourced from the chosen template.
- Users can still edit or add ingredients before saving.
- The “Common Meals” experience is backed by admin-defined templates; no divergence between labels and underlying data.
- No regression for users who prefer manual entry.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Confusion if both preset and template paths remain separate.
  - Mitigation: Unify UI and terminology; provide a single, discoverable path.
- Risk: Backend categories/tags may not map 1:1 to “common meals”.
  - Mitigation: Use a default category or add a “common” tag for curated sets.

This plan keeps current capabilities intact while making the “choose from options” flow align with predefined meals, removing the need to re-enter ingredients when a common/predefined meal is selected.
